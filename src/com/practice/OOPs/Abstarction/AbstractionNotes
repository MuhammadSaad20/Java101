Abstraction: Hides complex implementation details and shows only the essential features of the object.


Why Abstraction? When building a car, you donâ€™t need to know how the engine works to drive it.
                 You just need an interface like the accelerator, brake, and steering.



Abstract methods define behavior without specifying the details.
Child classes provide specific implementations.
