DeadLocks:

A deadlock occurs in concurrent programming when two or more threads are blocked forever,
each waiting for the other to release a resource.
This typically happens when threads hold locks on resources and request additional locks held by other threads.

Deadlock occurs:

1- Mutual Exclusion: Only one thread access one at a time
2- Hold and Wait: A thread holding at least ons resources is waiting to acquired additional resource held by other thread
3- No Preemption: Resource cannot forcibly taken from thread holding them
4- Circular wait: A set of threads is waiting for each other in a circular chain

we can prevent by managing this using lock in order
