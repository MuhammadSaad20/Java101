Can we extern implement at same time for a class In Java?

You can able to declare extends and implements together.But one condition you have to declare extends before implements keyword.

// example

public class Dog extends Animal implements Interface1,Interface2
{
         //you should implement all methods here...
}


Runnable vs Thread: https://engineeringdigest.medium.com/multithreading-in-java-39f34724bbf6

Use Runnable when you want to separate the task from the thread, allowing the class to extend another class if needed.
Extend Thread if you need to override
Thread methods or if the task inherently requires direct control over the thread itself, though this limits inheritance.
