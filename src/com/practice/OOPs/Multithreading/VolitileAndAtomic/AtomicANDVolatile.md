### **`volatile` vs `Atomic` in Java**

Both `volatile` and `atomic` are used to handle concurrency issues in Java, but they have distinct use cases and functionalities.

---

### **1. `volatile`**
The `volatile` keyword is used to indicate that a variable's value will be modified by multiple threads. It ensures visibility and prevents thread-local caching of the variable.

#### **Key Features**:
1. **Visibility**:
    - Changes to a `volatile` variable made by one thread are visible to other threads immediately.
2. **No Synchronization**:
    - Does not use locks or ensure atomicity for compound actions like increment or decrement.
3. **Lightweight**:
    - Uses CPU-level memory barriers for visibility without overhead of locking.

#### **When to Use**:
- When you need a simple flag or variable to be visible across threads.
- When compound operations (like `count++`) are not involved.

#### **Example**:
```java
class VolatileExample {
    private volatile boolean running = true;

    public void stop() {
        running = false; // Visible to all threads immediately
    }

    public void start() {
        while (running) {
            // Do some work
        }
        System.out.println("Stopped!");
    }
}
```

### **2. `Atomic` (e.g., `AtomicInteger`)**
Atomic classes (like `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicLong`, and `AtomicReference`) are part of the `java.util.concurrent.atomic` package and provide thread-safe operations for single variables.

#### **Key Features**:
1. **Atomicity**:
    - Ensures compound actions (like increment and compare-and-swap) are performed atomically without explicit synchronization.
2. **Performance**:
    - Uses low-level CPU instructions like compare-and-swap (CAS), avoiding locks.
3. **Thread Safety**:
    - Suitable for counters, flags, and other shared variables requiring atomic updates.

#### **When to Use**:
- When compound operations (like incrementing a counter) are required in a thread-safe way.

#### **Example**:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

public class AtomicExample {
    private AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger();

    public void increment() {
        counter.incrementAndGet(); // Atomic operation
    }

    public int getCounter() {
        return counter.get();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AtomicExample example = new AtomicExample();
        example.increment();
        System.out.println("Counter: " + example.getCounter());
    }
}
```

### **Comparison Table**

| Feature                     | `volatile`                           | `Atomic`                                   |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                 | Ensures visibility of changes across threads. | Provides atomic operations for variables.  |
| **Atomicity**               | Not guaranteed for compound actions. | Guaranteed for operations like increment.  |
| **Thread Safety**           | Only ensures visibility.             | Thread-safe for all operations.            |
| **Use Case**                | Flags, simple variables.             | Counters, CAS operations, shared variables.|
| **Performance**             | Lightweight (no locking overhead).   | Slightly heavier due to CAS operations.    |
| **Scope**                   | Works on primitive data types.       | Works on primitives and objects.           |

### **Key Differences**
1. `volatile` only ensures visibility, while `Atomic` ensures both visibility and atomicity.
2. Operations like `counter++` are not thread-safe with `volatile` but are safe with `AtomicInteger`.

---

### **When to Use Which?**
- Use **`volatile`** if:
    - The variable is a flag (e.g., `boolean running`).
    - No compound actions (like increment) are involved.

- Use **`Atomic`** if:
    - You need atomic updates, like counters or CAS operations.
    - Thread-safe compound actions are required.
